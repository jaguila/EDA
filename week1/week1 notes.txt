Exploratory Data analysis 
week 1

Graphs
	understand, find patterns, suggest modeling, and debug analysis
	Exploratory
		made quickly
		large number
		goals - personal understanding
		Axes/Legends are generally cleaned up
		color/size are primarily used for information

example
	air pollution
		question
			are there any counties in the US that exceen the limit of 12 microgram/m^3
		Data available from US EPA website

sample code
	pollution<-read.csv(".csv", colClasses = c("numeric,"character","factor","numeric","numeric")) #reads in and it sets the classes for each column
	head(pollution) #prints out the first few rows of the dataset
	data
		pm25 - annual average 
		fips - identifier for the county
		region - region
		longitude and latitude - location coordinates of the monitor
		
questions to ask
	you should have a questions to drive your explanation
	one dimension
		5 number summary
			min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, max
			code: summary(pollution$pm25) # dataset$column
		boxplots
			Code: boxplot(pollution$pm25, col="blue)
			ablint(h=12) # overlays a line at a certain point
		histograms
			code: hist(pollution$pm25,col="green", breaks=100) #breaks are the number of bars in the histogram bar graph
			rug(pollution$pm25) #plots all of the points under the histogram
			abline(v=12, lwd=2) #creates overlay which is vertical at 12 and line width of 2
			abline(v=median(pollution$pm25), col = "magenta", lwd=4) #creates line at the median of the pollution$pm25 and color of magenta
		density plot
		barplot
			code: barplot(table(pollution$region), col="wheat", main="Number of counties in Each Region")
	two dimensional plots
		multiple/overlayed 1-dplots"
