Exploratory Data analysis 
week 1

Graphs
	understand, find patterns, suggest modeling, and debug analysis
	Exploratory
		made quickly
		large number
		goals - personal understanding
		Axes/Legends are generally cleaned up
		color/size are primarily used for information

example
	air pollution
		question
			are there any counties in the US that exceen the limit of 12 microgram/m^3
		Data available from US EPA website

sample code
	pollution<-read.csv(".csv", colClasses = c("numeric,"character","factor","numeric","numeric")) #reads in and it sets the classes for each column into a dataframe
	head(pollution) #prints out the first few rows of the dataset
	data
		pm25 - annual average 
		fips - identifier for the county
		region - region
		longitude and latitude - location coordinates of the monitor
		
questions to ask
	you should have a questions to drive your explanation
	one dimension
		5 number summary
			min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, max
			code: summary(pollution$pm25) # dataset$column
		boxplots
			Code: boxplot(pollution$pm25, col="blue)
			abline(h=12) # overlays a line at a certain point
		histograms
			code: hist(pollution$pm25,col="green", breaks=100) #breaks are the number of bars in the histogram bar graph
			rug(pollution$pm25) #plots all of the points under the histogram
			abline(v=12, lwd=2) #creates overlay which is vertical at 12 and line width of 2
			abline(v=median(pollution$pm25), col = "magenta", lwd=4) #creates line at the median of the pollution$pm25 and color of magenta
		density plot
		barplot
			code: barplot(table(pollution$region), col="wheat", main="Number of counties in Each Region")
	two dimensional plots
		multiple/overlayed 1-dplots (lattice/ggplot2)
			multiple boxplots
				boxplot(pm25~region, data = pollution, col="red")
				y~x
				use this to see pm25 seperated by the different factors of region
				ex.
					pm25 higher in east than west but extremes are in west and larger spread
			multiple histograms
				par(mfrow = c(2,1), mar=c(4,4,2,1))
				hist(subset(pollution,region=="east")$pm25, col="green")
				hist(subset(pollution, region=="west")$pm25, col="green")
					subset(x, cond) - subsets dataframe x using filter of cond)
					par(mfrow,mar) - plots based on parameters
						multiple graphs per col(mfcol) or row(mfrow)
						mar - margin
				ex.
					east - higher on average but not to many extreme values
					west - lower on average but large extremes
		scatterplots
			with(pollution, plot(latitude,pm25))
			abline(h=12, lwd=2, lty=2)
				with(x,y) - applies expression y onto dataset/dataframe x
			ex.
				use to see North south trend
				PM25 is higher in the middle latitudes
			
			with(pollution,plot(latitude, pm25, col=region))
			this adds another dimension by using color
			ex.
				black dots are East and red are west columns
		smooth scatterplots
			par(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(5,4,2,1))
			with(subset(pollution,region=="west"),plot(latitude,pm25, main="West")
			with(subset(pollution,region=="east"),plot(latitude,pm25, main="East")
			ex.
				you can see that both cases higher pllution are in the middle latitudes, ends of the latitudes have lower pm25
			
	>2 dimension
		overlayed/multple 2-d plots; coplots
		used color, size, shape to add dimensions
		spinning plots
		actual 3-d plots(not very useful)

different plotting systems
	base plotting system
		start with blank canvas and build up from there
		start with plot function then annotate plot
		pros
			convenient, mirors how we think and analyze
			simple commands
		cons
			have to keep track of code
			can't go back(adjust margins)
			difficult to transflate to others once a new plot as been created
	lattice system
		plots created with single function call
